# hoMEal - Home made food delivery app

This Home made food delivery app creates a platform to connect home made food sellers and customers. home-cooked food can provide a higher quality, more personalized, and healthier dining experience, while also supporting small home made businesses.

- To get started, users would need to create an account and provide their delivery address.
- On the homepage, users would see a list of available home cooks in their area, along with their menu items and prices. Users can filter the list by cuisine type, price range,proximity and other criteria to find the perfect meal.They can also mark their favourite restaurants and home cooks as "favorites" for quick and easy access in the future.
- Once they have selected their items, users can add them to their cart and proceed to checkout. At checkout, they can review their order,apply coupons if any, enter their payment information, and place their order.
- In addition to individual orders, the app would also offer a tiffin service, where users can subscribe to receive daily or weekly home-cooked meals delivered to their doorstep. Users can choose from a variety of tiffin plans, such as vegetarian or non-vegetarian, and customize their meals with any allergies or dietary restrictions.
- The app would use Firebase as the back-end to store user accounts, orders, and restaurant and home cook information. It would also handle the payment processing using a secure third-party payment gateway.
- After the order is placed, the restaurant or home cook would receive a notification and begin preparing the food for delivery. The app would provide real-time updates on the status of the order, including the estimated time of delivery.
- Overall, a home-made food delivery app developed in Flutter and Firebase would provide a convenient and hassle-free way for users to discover and order delicious meals from home cooks.
